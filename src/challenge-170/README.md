# Daily Challenge #170 - Pokemon Damage Calculator

https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-170-pokemon-damage-calculator-97d

## Setup

```js
For this challenge, you'll be thrown into a Pokemon battle! Calculate the damage that a particular move would do using the following formula:

total damage = base damage - (attack / defense) - effectiveness

base damage = the original power of the attack
attack = your attack stat
defense = the opponent's defense stat
effectiveness = the effectiveness of the attack based on the type matchup

Attacks can be super effective, neutral, or not very effective depending on the matchup.

super effective : 2x damage
neutral: 1x damage
not very effective: 0.5x damage
To prevent the challenge from being too tedious, you'll only deal with four types: fire, water, grass, and electric. Here are the matchups:

fire > grass
fire < water
fire = electric
water < grass
water < electric
grass = electric
\*\*Any type against itself is not very effective
Overall, the function you implement must take in:

your type
the opponent's type
attack power
the opponent's defense
... and must output the total damage of the attack.

```

## Tests

```js
What are the total damage outputs of these attacks?

"grass", "electric", 57, 19
"grass", "water", 40, 40
"grass", "fire", 35, 5
"fire", "electric", 10, 2
