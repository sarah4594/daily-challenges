# Daily Challenge #148 - Disemvowel Trolls

https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-148-disemvowel-trolls-h76

## Setup

Trolls are invading the comment section!

To deal with the threat, write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed (y not included).

## Examples

```js
"This website is for losers LOL!" => "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL"
```

## Tests

```js
"No newbies allowed, go to #beginners" =>
"LULZ TROLLED" =>
```
