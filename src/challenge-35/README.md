https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-35-find-the-outlier-31pe

## Setup

In this challenge, you'll be given an array with a length of at least three, containing (possibly quite large) integers. The array is either comprised of entirely odd integers or even integers with one exception. Write a method that returns the integer that is not like the others.

## Examples

```js
findOutlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]) => 11
```

## Tests

```js
;[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21],
  [4, 8, 15, 16, 24, 42],
  [16, 6, 40, 66, 68, 28]
```
