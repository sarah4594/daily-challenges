# Daily Challenge #183 - Automorphic Numbers

https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-183-automorphic-numbers-3mmj

## Setup

```js
For this challenge, implement a function that will return true if a number is Automorphic. Automorphics are numbers whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself. The number will always be positive.
```

## Examples

```js
autoMorphic(13) => false
13 squared is 69. Since 69 does not end in 13, return false.

autoMorphic(25) => true
25 squared is 625. Since 625 ends in 25, return true.
```

## Tests

```js
autoMorphic(6)

autoMorphic(625)

autoMorphic(225)
```
