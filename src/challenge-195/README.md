# Daily Challenge #195 - No Zeroes for Heroes

https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-195-no-zeroes-for-heroes-2mm4

## Setup

It has officially been decided that numbers that end with zeroes are boring. They might be fun in your world, but definitely not here. Implement a function to eradicate any trailing zeroes. If the given number is 0, just leave him alone. Poor guy anyway.

## Examples

```js
1450 -> 145
960000 -> 96
1050 -> 105
-1050 -> -105
```

## Tests

```js
9070
210000
10210
0
```
