https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-172-find-all-in-an-array-3nob

## Setup

```js
Implement a function that will accept an array of integers and an integer n. Find all occurrences of n in the given array and return another array containing all the index positions of n in the array.

If n is not in the given array, return an empty array [].

Assume thatn and all values in the array will always be integers.

```

## Examples

```js
find_all([6, 9, 3, 4, 3, 82, 11], 3) > [2, 4]
```

## Tests

```js
;[6, 9, 3, 4, 3, 82, 11],
  (3)[(10, 16, 20, 6, 14, 11, 20, 2, 17, 16, 14)],
  (16)[
    (20, 20, 10, 13, 15, 2, 7, 2, 20, 3, 18, 2, 3, 2, 16, 10, 9, 9, 7, 5, 15, 5)
  ],
