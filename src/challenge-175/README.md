# Daily Challenge #175 - Complementary DNA

https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-175-complementary-dna-6o1

## Setup

```js
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" and "C" and "G" are complements of each other. Implement a function DNA_strand to match the given side of DNA with its complementary side.
```

## Examples

```js
DNA_strand("ATTGC") # return TAACG
DNA_strand("GTTAAC") # return CAATTG
```

## Tests

```js
DNA_strand('AAAA')
DNA_strand('CTACC')
DNA_strand('GTAT')
```
